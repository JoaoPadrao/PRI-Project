It is one of only two pitched battles that Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n is known to have fought, and the only of the two not coincident with a siege. His opponent at Valdevez was his cousin Afonso I of Portugal. An armistice signed after the battle eventually became the Treaty of Zamora (1143), and ended Portugal's first war of independence. The area of the battle became known as the Veiga or Campo da Matan\u00e7a, the \"field of killing\".",
