It was one of three encampments erected by Red Stick Creeks that summer. In addition to the physical defenses, Creek prophets performed ceremonies at the site to create a spiritual barrier of protection. Hence the Creek name \"Econochaca,\" loosely translated as holy ground, but properly translated as sacred or beloved ground.",

He had fortified Syracuse against sieges and had created a large army of mercenaries and a large fleet, in addition to employing the catapult and quinqueremes for the first time in history. In 398 BC, he attacked and sacked the Phoenician city of Motya despite the Carthaginian relief effort led by Himilco. Carthage also lost most of her territorial gains secured in 405 BC after Dionysius declared war on Carthage in 398 BC.",

The end of the conflict is sometimes called the Genna Armistice (\u5143\u548c\u5043\u6b66, Genna Enbu), because the era name was changed from Keich\u014d to Genna immediately following the siege.",
