The Allies consisted of British Imperial Forces, including a Greek contingent, with American and French corps. The campaign opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces but the massive supply interdiction efforts  led to the decisive defeat of the Axis. Over 260,000 German and Italian troops were taken as prisoners of war, including most of the Afrika Korps."

The battle convinced United States Army officers of the value of naval artillery support, and revealed problems coordinating air support from autonomous air forces during amphibious operations."

The United States suffered heavy losses, but maintained control of the fort.  The battle exposed a division in the Western Confederacy's military strategy at a time when they seemed to hold the advantage, and the United States pressed farther into the Northwest Territory."
